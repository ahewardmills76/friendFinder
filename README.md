# friendFinder
Week 12


This is a friend matching app that utilizes Mongo and Express.  Users click on the survey,
enter their answers to questions, and the data is pushed into a friends array of objects.
A javascript function  compares the data to pre-existing entries and returns as a modal
the best match.

This is as far as I got with the app, but much of the functionality is broken
since updating:
